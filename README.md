# BiomeTweaker-scripts
Hey! This is where I will be uploading my scripts for the mod BiomeTweaker
Ever wanted to play in a Minecraft world which is almost all water? 
If you want to explore islands as you play the game this script for the mod BiomeTweaker will help you out.
Just download the mod and write this script in the scripts file within the config. file. 
Generate the world and there you go!
